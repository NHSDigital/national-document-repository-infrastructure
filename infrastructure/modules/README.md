# Modules folder for Terraform Modules

This directory contains reusable Terraform modules that can be resused for multiple resource instances. Each module is designed to encapsulate specific functionality, making it easier to manage and deploy infrastructure components consistently.

Each module includes its own `README.md` file with detailed information on usage, inputs, outputs, and examples.
